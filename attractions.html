                <br>
                Galway City Museum was founded in 1976. It was originally located in Comerford House, which prior to
                this had been the home of artist Clare Sheridan. The museum began as a residual collection of medieval
                stones from the city, acquired by Sheridan. Curated by Etienne Ryan, Michael Keaney, Bill Scanlan and
                Jim Higgins the museum built up a general folklife, industrial and militia collection.

                The Spanish Arch and the Caoċ Arch in Galway city, Ireland, are two remaining arches on the Ceann an
                Bhalla ("Front Wall").
                The two arches were part of the extension of the city wall from Martin's Tower to the bank of the River
                Corrib, as a measure to protect the city's quays, which were in the area once known as the Fish Market
                (now Spanish Parade). It was constructed during the mayoralty of Wylliam Martin in 1584, being called
                ceann an bhalla (the head of the wall).

                If visiting Galway, then a trip to The Latin Quarter is a must! Often referred to as the cultural heart

                time. Experience a unique festive-like atmosphere strolling through the mainly pedestrianised
                cobblestoned streets lined with street performers and entertainers.

                <br>
                The Collegiate Church of St. Nicholas is a medieval church building in Galway, Ireland. It is a
                collegiate church and the parish church of St. Nicholas Church of Ireland parish, which covers Galway
                City. It was founded in 1320 and dedicated to Saint Nicholas of Myra, the patron saint of seafarers, in
                recognition of Galway's status as a port. The monumental work of Irish genealogy, the Leabhar na
                nGenealach was produced here in 1650 by Duḃaltaċ MacḞirḃisiġ (Dubhaltach MacFhirbhisigh).

                <strong>Aran Island Ferries</strong>
                <br>
                The Aran Islands offer visitors a glimpse into a way of life that has long since disappeared from most
                of the world. Filled with traditional Irish culture, the islands offer breath-taking scenery,
                ecclesiastical ruins and world-renowned stone forts. Depending on which island you visit, the ferry
                journey is approximately 40-minutes from Rossaveel, Connemara and 90-minutes from Galway City.
